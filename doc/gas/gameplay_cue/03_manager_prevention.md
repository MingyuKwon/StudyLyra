## 개념 요약

<a name="concepts-gc-manager"></a>
#### 4.8.5 Gameplay Cue Manager
By default, the `GameplayCueManager` will scan the entire game directory for `GameplayCueNotifies` and load them into memory on play. We can change the path where the `GameplayCueManager` scans by setting it in the `DefaultGame.ini`.

```
[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
GameplayCueNotifyPaths="/Game/GASDocumentation/Characters"
```

We do want the `GameplayCueManager` to scan and find all of the `GameplayCueNotifies`; however, we don't want it to async load every single one on play. This will put every `GameplayCueNotify` and all of their referenced sounds and particles into memory regardless if they're even used in a level. In a large game like Paragon, this can be hundreds of megabytes of unneeded assets in memory and cause hitching and game freezes on startup.

An alternative to async loading every `GameplayCue` on startup is to only async load `GameplayCues` as they're triggered in-game. This mitigates the unnecessary memory usage and potential game hard freezes while async loading every `GameplayCue` in exchange for potentially delayed effects for the first time that a specific `GameplayCue` is triggered during play. This potential delay is nonexistent for SSDs. I have not tested on a HDD. If using this option in the UE Editor, there may be slight hitches or freezes during the first load of GameplayCues if the Editor needs to compile particle systems. This is not an issue in builds as the particle systems will already be compiled.

First we must subclass `UGameplayCueManager` and tell the `AbilitySystemGlobals` class to use our `UGameplayCueManager` subclass in `DefaultGame.ini`.

```
[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
GlobalGameplayCueManagerClass="/Script/ParagonAssets.PBGameplayCueManager"
```

In our `UGameplayCueManager` subclass, override `ShouldAsyncLoadRuntimeObjectLibraries()`.

```c++
virtual bool ShouldAsyncLoadRuntimeObjectLibraries() const override
{
	return false;
}
```

#### 4.8.6 Prevent Gameplay Cues from Firing
Sometimes we don't want `GameplayCues` to fire. For example if we block an attack, we may not want to play the hit impact attached to the damage `GameplayEffect` or play a custom one instead. We can do this inside of [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](#concepts-ge-ec) by calling `OutExecutionOutput.MarkGameplayCuesHandledManually()` and then manually sending our `GameplayCue` event to the `Target` or `Source's` `ASC`.

If you never want any `GameplayCues` to fire on a specific `ASC`, you can set `AbilitySystemComponent->bSuppressGameplayCues = true;`.
