### 4.1.2 Setup and Initialization
`ASCs` are typically constructed in the `OwnerActor's` constructor and explicitly marked replicated. **This must be done in C++**.

```c++
AGDPlayerState::AGDPlayerState()
{
	// Create ability system component, and set it to be explicitly replicated
	AbilitySystemComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UGDAbilitySystemComponent>(TEXT("AbilitySystemComponent"));
	AbilitySystemComponent->SetIsReplicated(true);
	//...
}
```

The `ASC` needs to be initialized with its `OwnerActor` and `AvatarActor` on both the server and the client. You want to initialize after the `Pawn's` `Controller` has been set (after possession). Single player games only need to worry about the server path.

For player controlled characters where the `ASC` lives on the `Pawn`, I typically initialize on the server in the `Pawn's` `PossessedBy()` function and initialize on the client in the `PlayerController's` `AcknowledgePossession()` function.

```c++
void APACharacterBase::PossessedBy(AController * NewController)
{
	Super::PossessedBy(NewController);

	if (AbilitySystemComponent)
	{
		AbilitySystemComponent->InitAbilityActorInfo(this, this);
	}

	// ASC MixedMode replication requires that the ASC Owner's Owner be the Controller.
	SetOwner(NewController);
}
```

```c++
void APAPlayerControllerBase::AcknowledgePossession(APawn* P)
{
	Super::AcknowledgePossession(P);

	APACharacterBase* CharacterBase = Cast<APACharacterBase>(P);
	if (CharacterBase)
	{
		CharacterBase->GetAbilitySystemComponent()->InitAbilityActorInfo(CharacterBase, CharacterBase);
	}

	//...
}
```

For player controlled characters where the `ASC` lives on the `PlayerState`, I typically initialize the server in the `Pawn's` `PossessedBy()` function and initialize on the client in the `Pawn's` `OnRep_PlayerState()` function. This ensures that the `PlayerState` exists on the client.

```c++
// Server only
void AGDHeroCharacter::PossessedBy(AController * NewController)
{
	Super::PossessedBy(NewController);

	AGDPlayerState* PS = GetPlayerState<AGDPlayerState>();
	if (PS)
	{
		// Set the ASC on the Server. Clients do this in OnRep_PlayerState()
		AbilitySystemComponent = Cast<UGDAbilitySystemComponent>(PS->GetAbilitySystemComponent());

		// AI won't have PlayerControllers so we can init again here just to be sure. No harm in initing twice for heroes that have PlayerControllers.
		PS->GetAbilitySystemComponent()->InitAbilityActorInfo(PS, this);
	}
	
	//...
}
```

```c++
// Client only
void AGDHeroCharacter::OnRep_PlayerState()
{
	Super::OnRep_PlayerState();

	AGDPlayerState* PS = GetPlayerState<AGDPlayerState>();
	if (PS)
	{
		// Set the ASC for clients. Server does this in PossessedBy.
		AbilitySystemComponent = Cast<UGDAbilitySystemComponent>(PS->GetAbilitySystemComponent());

		// Init ASC Actor Info for clients. Server will init its ASC when it possesses a new Actor.
		AbilitySystemComponent->InitAbilityActorInfo(PS, this);
	}

	// ...
}
```

If you get the error message `LogAbilitySystem: Warning: Can't activate LocalOnly or LocalPredicted ability %s when not local!` then you did not initialize your `ASC` on the client.
