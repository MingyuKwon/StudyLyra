#### 4.3.3 Meta Attributes
Some `Attributes` are treated as placeholders for temporary values that are intended to interact with `Attributes`. These are called `Meta Attributes`. For example, we commonly define damage as a `Meta Attribute`. Instead of a `GameplayEffect` directly changing our health `Attribute`, we use a `Meta Attribute` called damage as a placeholder. This way the damage value can be modified with buffs and debuffs in an [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculation`](#concepts-ge-ec) and can be further manipulated in the `AttributeSet`, for example subtracting the damage from a current shield `Attribute`, before finally subtracting the remainder from the health `Attribute`. The damage `Meta Attribute` has no persistence between `GameplayEffects` and is overriden by every one. `Meta Attributes` are not typically replicated.

`Meta Attributes` provide a good logical separation for things like damage and healing between "How much damage did we do?" and "What do we do with this damage?". This logical separation means our `Gameplay Effects` and `Execution Calculations` don't need to know how the Target handles the damage. Continuing our damage example, the `Gameplay Effect` determines how much damage and then the `AttributeSet` decides what to do with that damage. Not all characters may have the same `Attributes`, especially if you use subclassed `AttributeSets`. The base `AttributeSet` class may only have a health `Attribute`, but a subclassed `AttributeSet` may add a shield `Attribute`. The subclassed `AttributeSet` with the shield `Attribute` would distribute the damage received differently than the base `AttributeSet` class.

While `Meta Attributes` are a good design pattern, they are not mandatory. If you only ever have one `Execution Calculation` used for all instances of damage and one `Attribute Set` class shared by all characters, then you may be fine doing the damage distribution to health, shields, etc. inside of the `Execution Calculation` and directly modifying those `Attributes`. You'll only be sacrificing flexibility, but that may be okay for you.
