#### 4.3.2 BaseValue vs CurrentValue
An `Attribute` is composed of two values - a `BaseValue` and a `CurrentValue`. The `BaseValue` is the permanent value of the `Attribute` whereas the `CurrentValue` is the `BaseValue` plus temporary modifications from `GameplayEffects`. For example, your `Character` may have a movespeed `Attribute` with a `BaseValue` of 600 units/second. Since there are no `GameplayEffects` modifying the movespeed yet, the `CurrentValue` is also 600 u/s. If she gets a temporary 50 u/s movespeed buff, the `BaseValue` stays the same at 600 u/s while the `CurrentValue` is now 600 + 50 for a total of 650 u/s. When the movespeed buff expires, the `CurrentValue` reverts back to the `BaseValue` of 600 u/s.

Often beginners to GAS will confuse `BaseValue` with a maximum value for an `Attribute` and try to treat it as such. This is an incorrect approach. Maximum values for `Attributes` that can change or are referenced in abilities or UI should be treated as separate `Attributes`. For hardcoded maximum and minimum values, there is a way to define a `DataTable` with `FAttributeMetaData` that can set maximum and minimum values, but Epic's comment above the struct calls it a "work in progress". See `AttributeSet.h` for more information. To prevent confusion, I recommend that maximum values that can be referenced in abilities or UI be made as separate `Attributes` and hardcoded maximum and minimum values that are only used for clamping `Attributes` be defined as hardcoded floats in the `AttributeSet`. Clamping of `Attributes` is discussed in [PreAttributeChange()](#concepts-as-preattributechange) for changes to the `CurrentValue` and [PostGameplayEffectExecute()](#concepts-as-postgameplayeffectexecute) for changes to the `BaseValue` from `GameplayEffects`.

Permanent changes to the `BaseValue` come from `Instant` `GameplayEffects` whereas `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` change the `CurrentValue`. Periodic `GameplayEffects` are treated like instant `GameplayEffects` and change the `BaseValue`.
