#### 4.4.6 PostGameplayEffectExecute()
`PostGameplayEffectExecute(const FGameplayEffectModCallbackData & Data)` only triggers after changes to the `BaseValue` of an `Attribute` from an instant [`GameplayEffect`](#concepts-ge). This is a valid place to do more `Attribute` manipulation when they change from a `GameplayEffect`.

For example, in the Sample Project we subtract the final damage `Meta Attribute` from the health `Attribute` here. If there was a shield `Attribute`, we would subtract the damage from it first before subtracting the remainder from health. The Sample Project also uses this location to apply hit react animations, show floating Damage Numbers, and assign experience and gold bounties to the killer. By design, the damage `Meta Attribute` will always come through an instant `GameplayEffect` and never the `Attribute` setter.

Other `Attributes` that will only have their `BaseValue` changed from instant `GameplayEffects` like mana and stamina can also be clamped to their maximum value counterpart `Attributes` here.

**Note:** When `PostGameplayEffectExecute()` is called, changes to the `Attribute` have already happened, but they have not replicated back to clients yet so clamping values here will not cause two network updates to clients. Clients will only receive the update after clamping.
