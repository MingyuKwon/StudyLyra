##### 4.4.2.3 Item Attributes (Weapon Ammo)
There's a few ways to implement equippable items with `Attributes` (weapon ammo, armor durability, etc). All of these approaches store values directly on the item. This is necessary for items that can be equipped by more than one player over its lifetime.

> 1. Use plain floats on the item (**Recommended**)
> 1. Separate `AttributeSet` on the item
> 1. Separate `ASC` on the item

###### 4.4.2.3.1 Plain Floats on the Item
Instead of `Attributes`, store plain float values on the item class instance. Fortnite and [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) handle gun ammo this way. For a gun, store the max clip size, current ammo in clip, reserve ammo, etc directly as replicated floats (`COND_OwnerOnly`) on the gun instance. If weapons share reserve ammo, you would move the reserve ammo onto the character as an `Attribute` in a shared ammo `AttributeSet` (reload abilities can use a `Cost GE` to pull from reserve ammo into the gun's float clip ammo). Since you're not using `Attributes` for current clip ammo, you will need to override some functions in `UGameplayAbility` to check and apply cost against the floats on the gun. Making the gun the `SourceObject` in the [`GameplayAbilitySpec`](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#concepts-ga-spec) when granting the ability means you'll have access to the gun that granted the ability inside the ability.

To prevent the gun from replicating back the ammo amount and clobbering the local ammo amount during automatic fire, disable replication while the player has a `IsFiring` `GameplayTag` in `PreReplication()`. You're essentially doing your own local prediction here.

```c++
void AGSWeapon::PreReplication(IRepChangedPropertyTracker& ChangedPropertyTracker)
{
	Super::PreReplication(ChangedPropertyTracker);

	DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE(AGSWeapon, PrimaryClipAmmo, (IsValid(AbilitySystemComponent) && !AbilitySystemComponent->HasMatchingGameplayTag(WeaponIsFiringTag)));
	DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE(AGSWeapon, SecondaryClipAmmo, (IsValid(AbilitySystemComponent) && !AbilitySystemComponent->HasMatchingGameplayTag(WeaponIsFiringTag)));
}
```

Benefits:
1. Avoids limitations of using `AttributeSets` (see below)

Limitations:
1. Can not use existing `GameplayEffect` workflow (`Cost GEs` for ammo use, etc)
1. Requires work to override key functions on `UGameplayAbility` to check and apply ammo costs against the gun's floats

###### 4.4.2.3.2 `AttributeSet` on the Item
Using a separate `AttributeSet` on the item that gets [added to the player's `ASC` on adding it to the player's inventory](#concepts-as-design-addremoveruntime) can work, but it has some major limitations. I had this working in early versions of [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) for the weapon ammo. The weapon stores its `Attributes` such as max clip size, current ammo in clip, reserve ammo, etc in an `AttributeSet` that lives on the weapon class. If weapons share reserve ammo, you would move the reserve ammo onto the character in a shared ammo `AttributeSet`. When a weapon is added to the player's inventory on the server, the weapon would add its `AttributeSet` to the player's `ASC::SpawnedAttributes`. The server would then replicate this down to the client. If the weapon is removed from the inventory, it would remove its `AttributeSet` from the `ASC::SpawnedAttributes`.

When the `AttributeSet` lives on something other than the `OwnerActor` (say a weapon), you'll initially get some compilation errors in the `AttributeSet`. The fix is to construct the `AttributeSet` in `BeginPlay()` instead of in the constructor and to implement `IAbilitySystemInterface` (set the pointer to the `ASC` when you add the weapon to the player inventory) on the weapon.

```c++
void AGSWeapon::BeginPlay()
{
	if (!AttributeSet)
	{
		AttributeSet = NewObject<UGSWeaponAttributeSet>(this);
	}
	//...
}
```

You can see it in practice by checking out this [older version of GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter/tree/df5949d0dd992bd3d76d4a728f370f2e2c827735).

Benefits:
1. Can use existing `GameplayAbility` and `GameplayEffect` workflow (`Cost GEs` for ammo use, etc)
1. Simple to setup for a very small set of items

Limitations:
1. You have to make a new `AttributeSet` class for every weapon type. `ASCs` can only functionally have one `AttributeSet` instance of a class since changes to an `Attribute` look for the first instance of their `AttributeSet` class in the `ASCs` `SpawnedAttributes` array. Additional instances of the same `AttributeSet` class are ignored.
1. You can only have one of each type of weapon in the player's inventory due to previous reason of one `AttributeSet` instance per `AttributeSet` class.
1. Removing an `AttributeSet` is dangerous. In GASShooter if the player killed himself from a rocket, the player would immediately remove the rocket launcher from his inventory (including its `AttributeSet` from the `ASC`). When the server replicated that the rocket launcher's ammo `Attribute` changed, the `AttributeSet` no longer existed on the client's `ASC` and the game crashed.

###### 4.4.2.3.3 `ASC` on the Item
Putting a whole `AbilitySystemComponent` on each item is an extreme approach. I have not personally done this nor have I seen it in the wild. It would take a lot of engineering to make it work.

> Is it viable to have several AbilitySystemComponents which have the same owner but different avatars (e.g. on pawn and weapon/items/projectiles with Owner set to PlayerState)?
> 
> The first problem I see there would be implementing the IGameplayTagAssetInterface and IAbilitySystemInterface on the owning actor. The former may be possible: just aggregate the tags from all all ASCs (but watch out -HasAllMatchingGameplayTags may be met only via cross ASC aggregation. It wouldn't be enough to just forward that calls to each ASC and OR the results together). But the later is even trickier: which ASC is the authoritative one? If someone wants to apply a GE -which one should receive it? Maybe you can work these out but this side of the problem will be the hardest: owners will have multiple ASCs beneath them.
> 
> Separate ASCs on the pawn and the weapon can make sense on its own though. E.g, distinguishing between tags that describe the weapon vs those that describe the owning pawn. Maybe it does make sense that tags granted to the weapon also “apply” to the owner and nothing else (e.g, attributes and GEs are independent but the owner will aggregate the owned tags like I describe above). This could work out, I am sure. But having multiple ASCs with the same owner may get dicey.

Benefits:
1. Can use existing `GameplayAbility` and `GameplayEffect` workflow (`Cost GEs` for ammo use, etc)
1. Can reuse `AttributeSet` classes (one on each weapon's ASC)

Limitations:
1. Unknown engineering cost
1. Is it even possible?
