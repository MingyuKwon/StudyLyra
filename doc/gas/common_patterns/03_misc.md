### 5.5 Generating a Random Number on Client and Server
Sometimes you need to generate a "random" number inside of a `GameplayAbility` for things like bullet recoil or spread. The client and the server will both want to generate the same random numbers. To do this, we must set the `random seed` to be the same at the time of `GameplayAbility` activation. You will want to set the `random seed` each time you activate the `GameplayAbility` in case the client mispredicts activation and its random number sequence becomes out of synch with the server's.

| Seed Setting Method                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Use the activation prediction key                                            | The `GameplayAbility` activation prediction key is an int16 guaranteed to be synchronized and available in both the client and server in the `Activation()`. You can set this as the `random seed` on both the client and the server. The downside to this method is that the prediction key always starts at zero each time the game starts and consistently increments the value to use between generating keys. This means each match will have the exact same random number sequence. This may or may not be random enough for your needs. |
| Send a seed through an event payload when you activate the `GameplayAbility` | Activate your `GameplayAbility` by event and send the randomly generated seed from the client to the server via the replicated event payload. This allows for more randomness but the client could easily hack their game to only send the same seed value every time. Also activating `GameplayAbilities` by event will prevent them from activating from the input bind.                                                                                                                                                                     |

If your random deviation is small, most players won't notice that the sequence is the same every game and using the activation prediction key as the `random seed` should work for you. If you're doing something more complex that needs to be hacker proof, perhaps using a `Server Initiated` `GameplayAbility` would work better where the server can create the prediction key or generate the `random seed` to send via an event payload.

### 5.7 Non-Stacking Gameplay Effects but Only the Greatest Magnitude Actually Affects the Target
Slow effects in Paragon did not stack. Each slow instance applied and kept track of their lifetimes as normal, but only the greatest magnitude slow effect actually affected the `Character`. GAS provides for this scenario out of the box with `AggregatorEvaluateMetaData`. See [`AggregatorEvaluateMetaData()`](#concepts-as-onattributeaggregatorcreated) for details and implementation.

### 5.8 Generate Target Data While Game is Paused
If you need to pause the game while waiting to generate [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data) from a `WaitTargetData` `AbilityTask` from your player, I suggest instead of pausing to use `slomo 0`.

### 5.9 One Button Interaction System
[GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) implements a one button interaction system where the player can press or hold 'E' to interact with interactable objects like reviving a player, opening a weapon chest, and opening or closing a sliding door.
