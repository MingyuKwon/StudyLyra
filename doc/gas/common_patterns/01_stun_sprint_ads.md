## 개념 요약

<a name="cae-stun"></a>
### 5.1 Stun
Typically with stuns, we want to cancel all of a `Character's` active `GameplayAbilities`, prevent new `GameplayAbility` activations, and prevent movement throughout the duration of the stun. The Sample Project's Meteor `GameplayAbility` applies a stun on hit targets.

To cancel the target's active `GameplayAbilities`, we call `AbilitySystemComponent->CancelAbilities()` when the stun [`GameplayTag` is added](#concepts-gt-change).

To prevent new `GameplayAbilities` from activating while stunned, the `GameplayAbilities` are given the stun `GameplayTag` in their [`Activation Blocked Tags` `GameplayTagContainer`](#concepts-ga-tags).

To prevent movement while stunned, we override the `CharacterMovementComponent's` `GetMaxSpeed()` function to return 0 when the owner has the stun `GameplayTag`.

### 5.2 Sprint
The Sample Project provides an example of how to sprint - run faster while `Left Shift` is held down.

The faster movement is handled predictively by the `CharacterMovementComponent` by sending a flag over the network to the server. See `GDCharacterMovementComponent.h/cpp` for details.

The `GA` handles responding to the `Left Shift` input, tells the `CMC` to begin and stop sprinting, and to predictively charge stamina while `Left Shift` is pressed. See `GA_Sprint_BP` for details.

### 5.3 Aim Down Sights
The Sample Project handles this the exact same way as sprinting but decreasing the movement speed instead of increasing it.

See `GDCharacterMovementComponent.h/cpp` for details on predictively decreasing the movement speed.

See `GA_AimDownSight_BP` for details on handling the input. There is no stamina cost for aiming down sights.
