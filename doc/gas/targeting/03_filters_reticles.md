## 개념 요약

#### 4.11.3 Target Data Filters
Using both the `Make GameplayTargetDataFilter` and `Make Filter Handle` nodes, you can filter out the player's `Pawn` or select only a specific class. If you need more advanced filtering, you can subclass `FGameplayTargetDataFilter` and override the `FilterPassesForActor` function. 
```c++
USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct GASDOCUMENTATION_API FGDNameTargetDataFilter : public FGameplayTargetDataFilter
{
	GENERATED_BODY()

	/** Returns true if the actor passes the filter and will be targeted */
	virtual bool FilterPassesForActor(const AActor* ActorToBeFiltered) const override;
};
```

However, this will not work directly into the `Wait Target Data` node as it requires a `FGameplayTargetDataFilterHandle`. A new custom `Make Filter Handle` must be made to accept the subclass:
```c++
FGameplayTargetDataFilterHandle UGDTargetDataFilterBlueprintLibrary::MakeGDNameFilterHandle(FGDNameTargetDataFilter Filter, AActor* FilterActor)
{
	FGameplayTargetDataFilter* NewFilter = new FGDNameTargetDataFilter(Filter);
	NewFilter->InitializeFilterContext(FilterActor);

	FGameplayTargetDataFilterHandle FilterHandle;
	FilterHandle.Filter = TSharedPtr<FGameplayTargetDataFilter>(NewFilter);
	return FilterHandle;
}
```

#### 4.11.4 Gameplay Ability World Reticles
[`AGameplayAbilityWorldReticles`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/Abilities/AGameplayAbilityWorldReticle/index.html) (`Reticles`) visualize **who** you are targeting when targeting with non-`Instant` confirmed [`TargetActors`](#concepts-targeting-actors). `TargetActors` are responsible for the spawn and destroy lifetimes for all `Reticles`. `Reticles` are `AActors` so they can use any kind of visual component for representation. A common implementation as seen in [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) is to use a `WidgetComponent` to display a UMG Widget in screen space (always facing the player's camera). `Reticles` do not know which `AActor` that they're on, but you could subclass in that functionality on a custom `TargetActor`. `TargetActors` will typically update the `Reticle`'s location to the target's location on every `Tick()`.

GASShooter uses `Reticles` to show locked-on targets for the rocket launcher's secondary ability's homing rockets. The red indicator on the enemy is the `Reticle`. The similar white image is the rocket launcher's crosshair.

`Reticles` come with a handful of `BlueprintImplementableEvents` for designers (they're intended to be developed in Blueprints):

```c++
/** Called whenever bIsTargetValid changes value. */
UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = Reticle)
void OnValidTargetChanged(bool bNewValue);

/** Called whenever bIsTargetAnActor changes value. */
UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = Reticle)
void OnTargetingAnActor(bool bNewValue);

UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = Reticle)
void OnParametersInitialized();

UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = Reticle)
void SetReticleMaterialParamFloat(FName ParamName, float value);

UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = Reticle)
void SetReticleMaterialParamVector(FName ParamName, FVector value);
```

`Reticles` can optionally use [`FWorldReticleParameters`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/Abilities/FWorldReticleParameters/index.html) provided by the `TargetActor` for configuration. The default struct only provides one variable `FVector AOEScale`. While you can technically subclass this struct, the `TargetActor` will only accept the base struct. It seems a little short-sighted to not allow this to be subclassed with default `TargetActors`. However, if you make your own custom `TargetActor`, you can provide your own custom reticle parameters struct and manually pass it to your subclass of `AGameplayAbilityWorldReticles` when you spawn them.

`Reticles` are not replicated by default, but can be made replicated if it makes sense for your game to show other players who the local player is targeting.

`Reticles` will only display on the current valid target with the default `TargetActors`. For example, if you're using a `AGameplayAbilityTargetActor_SingleLineTrace` to trace for a target, the `Reticle` will only appear when the enemy is directly in the trace path. If you look away, the enemy is no longer a valid target and the `Reticle` will disappear. If you want the `Reticle` to stay on the last valid target, you will want to customize your `TargetActor` to remember the last valid target and keep the `Reticle` on them. I refer to these as persistent targets as they will persist until the `TargetActor` receives confirmation or cancellation, the `TargetActor` finds a new valid target in its trace/overlap, or the target is no longer valid (destroyed).  GASShooter uses persistent targets for its rocket launcher's secondary ability's homing rockets targeting.
