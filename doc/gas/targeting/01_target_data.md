#### 4.11.1 Target Data
[`FGameplayAbilityTargetData`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/Abilities/FGameplayAbilityTargetData/index.html) is a generic structure for targeting data meant to be passed across the network. `TargetData` will typically hold `AActor`/`UObject` references, `FHitResults`, and other generic location/direction/origin information. However, you can subclass it to put essentially anything that you want inside of them as a simple means to [pass data between the client and server in `GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga-data). The base struct `FGameplayAbilityTargetData` is not meant to be used directly but instead subclassed. `GAS` comes with a few subclassed `FGameplayAbilityTargetData` structs out of the box located in `GameplayAbilityTargetTypes.h`.

`TargetData` is typically produced by [`Target Actors`](#concepts-targeting-actors) or **created manually** and consumed by [`AbilityTasks`](#concepts-at) and [`GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ge) via the [`EffectContext`](#concepts-ge-context). As a result of being in the `EffectContext`, [`Executions`](#concepts-ge-ec), [`MMCs`](#concepts-ge-mmc), [`GameplayCues`](#concepts-gc), and the functions on the backend of the [`AttributeSet`](#concepts-as) can access the `TargetData`.

We don't typically pass around the `FGameplayAbilityTargetData` directly, instead we use a [`FGameplayAbilityTargetDataHandle`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/Abilities/FGameplayAbilityTargetDataHandle/index.html) which has an internal TArray of pointers to `FGameplayAbilityTargetData`. This intermediate struct provides support for polymorphism of the `TargetData`.

An example of inheritting from `FGameplayAbilityTargetData`:
```c++
USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct MYGAME_API FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData : public FGameplayAbilityTargetData
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:

    FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData()
    { }

    UPROPERTY()
    FName CoolName = NAME_None;

    UPROPERTY()
    FPredictionKey MyCoolPredictionKey;

    // This is required for all child structs of FGameplayAbilityTargetData
    virtual UScriptStruct* GetScriptStruct() const override
    {
    	return FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData::StaticStruct();
    }

	// This is required for all child structs of FGameplayAbilityTargetData
    bool NetSerialize(FArchive& Ar, class UPackageMap* Map, bool& bOutSuccess)
    {
	    // The engine already defined NetSerialize for FName & FPredictionKey, thanks Epic!
        CoolName.NetSerialize(Ar, Map, bOutSuccess);
        MyCoolPredictionKey.NetSerialize(Ar, Map, bOutSuccess);
        bOutSuccess = true;
        return true;
    }
}

template<>
struct TStructOpsTypeTraits<FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData> : public TStructOpsTypeTraitsBase2<FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData>
{
	enum
	{
        WithNetSerializer = true // This is REQUIRED for FGameplayAbilityTargetDataHandle net serialization to work
	};
};
```
For adding the target data to a handle:
```c++
UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure)
FGameplayAbilityTargetDataHandle MakeTargetDataFromCustomName(const FName CustomName)
{
	// Create our target data type, 
	// Handle's automatically cleanup and delete this data when the handle is destructed, 
	// if you don't add this to a handle then be careful because this deals with memory management and memory leaks so its safe to just always add it to a handle at some point in the frame!
	FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData* MyCustomData = new FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData();
	// Setup the struct's information to use the inputted name and any other changes we may want to do
	MyCustomData->CoolName = CustomName;
	
	// Make our handle wrapper for Blueprint usage
	FGameplayAbilityTargetDataHandle Handle;
	// Add the target data to our handle
	Handle.Add(MyCustomData);
	// Output our handle to Blueprint
	return Handle
}
```

For getting values it requires doing type safety checking, because the only way to get values from the handle's target data is by using generic C/C++ casting for it which is *NOT* type safe which can cause object slicing and crashes. For type checking there are multiple ways of doing this(however you want honestly) two common ways are:
- Gameplay Tag(s): You can use a subclass hierarchy where you know that anytime a certain code architecture's functionality occurs, you can cast for the base parent type and get its gameplay tag(s) and then compare against those for casting for inherited classes.
- Script Struct & Static Structs: You can instead do direct class comparison(which can involve a lot of IF statements or making some template functions), below is an example of doing this but basically you can get the script struct from any `FGameplayAbilityTargetData`(this is a nice advantage of it being a `USTRUCT` and requiring any inherited classes to specify the struct type in `GetScriptStruct`) and compare if its the type you're looking for. Below is an example of using these functions for type checking:
```c++
UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure)
FName GetCoolNameFromTargetData(const FGameplayAbilityTargetDataHandle& Handle, const int Index)
{   
    // NOTE, there is two versions of this '::Get(int32 Index)' function; 
    // 1) const version that returns 'const FGameplayAbilityTargetData*', good for reading target data values 
    // 2) non-const version that returns 'FGameplayAbilityTargetData*', good for modifying target data values
    FGameplayAbilityTargetData* Data = Handle.Get(Index); // This will valid check the index for you 
    
    // Valid check we have something to use, null data means nothing to cast for
    if(Data == nullptr)
    {
       	return NAME_None;
    }
    // This is basically the type checking pass, static_cast does not have type safety, this is why we do this check.
    // If we don't do this then it will object slice the struct and thus we have no way of making sure its that type.
    if(Data->GetScriptStruct() == FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData::StaticStruct())
    {
        // Here is when you would do the cast because we know its the correct type already
        FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData* CustomData = static_cast<FGameplayAbilityTargetData_CustomData*>(Data);    
        return CustomData->CoolName;
    }
    return NAME_None;
}
```
