## 개념 요약

<a name="concepts-ge-applying"></a>
#### 4.5.2 Applying Gameplay Effects
`GameplayEffects` can be applied in many ways from functions on [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) and functions on the `ASC` and usually take the form of `ApplyGameplayEffectTo`. The different functions are essentially convenience functions that will eventually call `UAbilitySystemComponent::ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToSelf()` on the `Target`.

To apply `GameplayEffects` outside of a `GameplayAbility` for example from a projectile, you need to get the `Target's` `ASC` and use one of its functions to `ApplyGameplayEffectToSelf`.

You can listen for when any `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` are applied to an `ASC` by binding to its delegate:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedDelegateToSelf.AddUObject(this, &APACharacterBase::OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedCallback);
```
The callback function:
```c++
virtual void OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedCallback(UAbilitySystemComponent* Target, const FGameplayEffectSpec& SpecApplied, FActiveGameplayEffectHandle ActiveHandle);
```

The server will always call this function regardless of replication mode. The autonomous proxy will only call this for replicated `GameplayEffects` in `Full` and `Mixed` replication modes. Simulated proxies will only call this in `Full` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

#### 4.5.3 Removing Gameplay Effects
`GameplayEffects` can be removed in many ways from functions on [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) and functions on the `ASC` and usually take the form of `RemoveActiveGameplayEffect`. The different functions are essentially convenience functions that will eventually call `FActiveGameplayEffectsContainer::RemoveActiveEffects()` on the `Target`.

To remove `GameplayEffects` outside of a `GameplayAbility`, you need to get the `Target's` `ASC` and use one of its functions to `RemoveActiveGameplayEffect`.

You can listen for when any `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` are removed from an `ASC` by binding to its delegate:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->OnAnyGameplayEffectRemovedDelegate().AddUObject(this, &APACharacterBase::OnRemoveGameplayEffectCallback);
```
The callback function:
```c++
virtual void OnRemoveGameplayEffectCallback(const FActiveGameplayEffect& EffectRemoved);
```

The server will always call this function regardless of replication mode. The autonomous proxy will only call this for replicated `GameplayEffects` in `Full` and `Mixed` replication modes. Simulated proxies will only call this in `Full` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).
