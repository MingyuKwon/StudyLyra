#### 4.5.16 Changing Active Gameplay Effect Duration
To change the time remaining for a `Cooldown GE` or any `Duration` `GameplayEffect`, we need to change the `GameplayEffectSpec's` `Duration`, update its `StartServerWorldTime`, update its `CachedStartServerWorldTime`, update its `StartWorldTime`, and rerun the check on the duration with `CheckDuration()`. Doing this on the server and marking the `FActiveGameplayEffect` dirty will replicate the changes to clients.
**Note:** This does involve a `const_cast` and may not be Epic's intended way of changing durations, but it seems to work well so far.

```c++
bool UPAAbilitySystemComponent::SetGameplayEffectDurationHandle(FActiveGameplayEffectHandle Handle, float NewDuration)
{
	if (!Handle.IsValid())
	{
		return false;
	}

	const FActiveGameplayEffect* ActiveGameplayEffect = GetActiveGameplayEffect(Handle);
	if (!ActiveGameplayEffect)
	{
		return false;
	}

	FActiveGameplayEffect* AGE = const_cast<FActiveGameplayEffect*>(ActiveGameplayEffect);
	if (NewDuration > 0)
	{
		AGE->Spec.Duration = NewDuration;
	}
	else
	{
		AGE->Spec.Duration = 0.01f;
	}

	AGE->StartServerWorldTime = ActiveGameplayEffects.GetServerWorldTime();
	AGE->CachedStartServerWorldTime = AGE->StartServerWorldTime;
	AGE->StartWorldTime = ActiveGameplayEffects.GetWorldTime();
	ActiveGameplayEffects.MarkItemDirty(*AGE);
	ActiveGameplayEffects.CheckDuration(Handle);

	AGE->EventSet.OnTimeChanged.Broadcast(AGE->Handle, AGE->StartWorldTime, AGE->GetDuration());
	OnGameplayEffectDurationChange(*AGE);

	return true;
}
```

<a name="concepts-ge-dynamic"></a>
#### 4.5.17 Creating Dynamic Gameplay Effects at Runtime
Creating Dynamic `GameplayEffects` at runtime is an advanced topic. You shouldn't have to do this too often.

Only `Instant` `GameplayEffects` can be created at runtime from scratch in C++. `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` cannot be created dynamically at runtime because when they replicate they look for the `GameplayEffect` class definition that does not exist. To achieve this functionality, you should instead make an archetype `GameplayEffect` class like you would normally do in the Editor. Then customize the `GameplayEffectSpec` instance with what you need at runtime.

`Instant` `GameplayEffects` created at runtime can also be called from within a [local predicted](#concepts-p) `GameplayAbility`. However, it is unknown yet if the dynamic creation can have side effects.

##### Examples

The Sample Project creates one to send the gold and experience points back to the killer of a character when it takes the killing blow in its `AttributeSet`.

```c++
// Create a dynamic instant Gameplay Effect to give the bounties
UGameplayEffect* GEBounty = NewObject<UGameplayEffect>(GetTransientPackage(), FName(TEXT("Bounty")));
GEBounty->DurationPolicy = EGameplayEffectDurationType::Instant;

int32 Idx = GEBounty->Modifiers.Num();
GEBounty->Modifiers.SetNum(Idx + 2);

FGameplayModifierInfo& InfoXP = GEBounty->Modifiers[Idx];
InfoXP.ModifierMagnitude = FScalableFloat(GetXPBounty());
InfoXP.ModifierOp = EGameplayModOp::Additive;
InfoXP.Attribute = UGDAttributeSetBase::GetXPAttribute();

FGameplayModifierInfo& InfoGold = GEBounty->Modifiers[Idx + 1];
InfoGold.ModifierMagnitude = FScalableFloat(GetGoldBounty());
InfoGold.ModifierOp = EGameplayModOp::Additive;
InfoGold.Attribute = UGDAttributeSetBase::GetGoldAttribute();

Source->ApplyGameplayEffectToSelf(GEBounty, 1.0f, Source->MakeEffectContext());
```

A second example shows a runtime `GameplayEffect` created within a local predicted `GameplayAbility`. Use at your own risk (see comments in code)!

```c++
UGameplayAbilityRuntimeGE::UGameplayAbilityRuntimeGE()
{
	NetExecutionPolicy = EGameplayAbilityNetExecutionPolicy::LocalPredicted;
}

void UGameplayAbilityRuntimeGE::ActivateAbility(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle Handle, const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo* ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilityActivationInfo ActivationInfo, const FGameplayEventData* TriggerEventData)
{
	if (HasAuthorityOrPredictionKey(ActorInfo, &ActivationInfo))
	{
		if (!CommitAbility(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo))
		{
			EndAbility(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, true, true);
		}

		// Create the GE at runtime.
		UGameplayEffect* GameplayEffect = NewObject<UGameplayEffect>(GetTransientPackage(), TEXT("RuntimeInstantGE"));
		GameplayEffect->DurationPolicy = EGameplayEffectDurationType::Instant; // Only instant works with runtime GE.

		// Add a simple scalable float modifier, which overrides MyAttribute with 42.
		// In real world applications, consume information passed via TriggerEventData.
		const int32 Idx = GameplayEffect->Modifiers.Num();
		GameplayEffect->Modifiers.SetNum(Idx + 1);
		FGameplayModifierInfo& ModifierInfo = GameplayEffect->Modifiers[Idx];
		ModifierInfo.Attribute.SetUProperty(UMyAttributeSet::GetMyModifiedAttribute());
		ModifierInfo.ModifierMagnitude = FScalableFloat(42.f);
		ModifierInfo.ModifierOp = EGameplayModOp::Override;

		// Apply the GE.

		// Create the GESpec here to avoid the behavior of ASC to create GESpecs from the GE class default object.
		// Since we have a dynamic GE here, this would create a GESpec with the base GameplayEffect class, so we
		// would lose our modifiers. Attention: It is unknown, if this "hack" done here can have drawbacks!
		// The spec prevents the GE object being collected by the GarbageCollector, since the GE is a UPROPERTY on the spec.
		FGameplayEffectSpec* GESpec = new FGameplayEffectSpec(GameplayEffect, {}, 0.f); // "new", since lifetime is managed by a shared ptr within the handle
		ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToOwner(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, FGameplayEffectSpecHandle(GESpec));
	}
	EndAbility(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, false, false);
}
```

#### 4.5.18 Gameplay Effect Containers
Epic's [Action RPG Sample Project](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/action-rpg) implements a structure called `FGameplayEffectContainer`. These are not in vanilla GAS but are extremely handy for containing `GameplayEffects` and [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data). It automates some of the effort like creating `GameplayEffectSpecs` from `GameplayEffects` and setting default values in its `GameplayEffectContext`. Making a `GameplayEffectContainer` in a `GameplayAbility` and passing it to spawned projectiles is very easy and straightforward. I opted not to implement the `GameplayEffectContainers` in the included Sample Project to show how you would work without them in vanilla GAS, but I highly recommend looking into them and considering adding them to your project.

To access the `GESpecs` inside of the `GameplayEffectContainers` to do things like adding `SetByCallers`, break the `FGameplayEffectContainer` and access the `GESpec` reference by its index in the array of `GESpecs`. This requires that you know the index ahead of time of the `GESpec` that you want to access.

`GameplayEffectContainers` also contain an optional efficient means of [targeting](#concepts-targeting-containers).
