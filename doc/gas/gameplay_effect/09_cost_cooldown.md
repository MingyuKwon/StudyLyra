#### 4.5.13 Custom Application Requirement
[`CustomApplicationRequirement`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UGameplayEffectCustomApplication-/index.html) (`CAR`) classes give the designers advanced control over whether a `GameplayEffect` can be applied versus the simple `GameplayTag` checks on the `GameplayEffect`. These can be implemented in Blueprint by overriding `CanApplyGameplayEffect()` and in C++ by overriding `CanApplyGameplayEffect_Implementation()`.

Examples of when to use `CARs`:
* `Target` needs to have a certain amount of an `Attribute`
* `Target` needs to have a certain number of stacks of a `GameplayEffect`

`CARs` can also do more advanced things like checking if an instance of this `GameplayEffect` is already on the `Target` and [changing the duration](#concepts-ge-duration) of the existing instance instead of applying a new instance (return false for `CanApplyGameplayEffect()`).

#### 4.5.14 Cost Gameplay Effect
[`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) have an optional `GameplayEffect` specifically designed to use as the cost of the ability. Costs are how much of an `Attribute` an `ASC` needs to have to be able to activate the `GameplayAbility`. If a `GA` cannot afford the `Cost GE`, then they will not be able to activate. This `Cost GE` should be an `Instant` `GameplayEffect` with one or more `Modifiers` that subtract from `Attributes`. By default, `Cost GEs` are meant to be predicted and it is recommended to maintain that capability meaning do not use `ExecutionCalculations`. `MMCs` are perfectly acceptable and encouraged for complex cost calculations.

When starting out, you will most likely have one unique `Cost GE` per `GA` that has a cost. A more advanced technique is to reuse one `Cost GE` for multiple `GAs` and just modify the `GameplayEffectSpec` created from the `Cost GE` with the `GA`-specific data (the cost value is defined on the `GA`). **This only works for `Instanced` abilities.**

Two techniques for reusing the `Cost GE`:

1. **Use an `MMC`.** This is the easiest method. Create an [`MMC`](#concepts-ge-mmc) that reads the cost value from the `GameplayAbility` instance which you can get from the `GameplayEffectSpec`.

```c++
float UPGMMC_HeroAbilityCost::CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation(const FGameplayEffectSpec & Spec) const
{
	const UPGGameplayAbility* Ability = Cast<UPGGameplayAbility>(Spec.GetContext().GetAbilityInstance_NotReplicated());

	if (!Ability)
	{
		return 0.0f;
	}

	return Ability->Cost.GetValueAtLevel(Ability->GetAbilityLevel());
}
```

In this example the cost value is an `FScalableFloat` on the `GameplayAbility` child class that I added to it.
```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cost")
FScalableFloat Cost;
```

2. **Override `UGameplayAbility::GetCostGameplayEffect()`.** Override this function and [create a `GameplayEffect` at runtime](#concepts-ge-dynamic) that reads the cost value on the `GameplayAbility`.

#### 4.5.15 Cooldown Gameplay Effect
[`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) have an optional `GameplayEffect` specifically designed to use as the cooldown of the ability. Cooldowns determine how long after activation the ability can be activated again. If a `GA` is still on cooldown, it cannot activate. This `Cooldown GE` should be a `Duration` `GameplayEffect` with no `Modifiers` and a unique `GameplayTag` per `GameplayAbility` or per ability slot (if your game has interchangeable abilities assigned to slots that share a cooldown) in the `GameplayEffect's` `GrantedTags` ("`Cooldown Tag`"). The `GA` actually checks for the presence of the `Cooldown Tag` instead of the presence of the `Cooldown GE`. By default, `Cooldown GEs` are meant to be predicted and it is recommended to maintain that capability meaning do not use `ExecutionCalculations`. `MMCs` are perfectly acceptable and encouraged for complex cooldown calculations.

When starting out, you will most likely have one unique `Cooldown GE` per `GA` that has a cooldown. A more advanced technique is to reuse one `Cooldown GE` for multiple `GAs` and just modify the `GameplayEffectSpec` created from the `Cooldown GE` with the `GA`-specific data (the cooldown duration and the `Cooldown Tag` are defined on the `GA`). **This only works for `Instanced` abilities.**

Two techniques for reusing the `Cooldown GE`:

1. **Use a [`SetByCaller`](#concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller).** This is the easiest method. Set the duration of your shared `Cooldown GE` to `SetByCaller` with a `GameplayTag`. On your `GameplayAbility` subclass, define a float / `FScalableFloat` for the duration, a `FGameplayTagContainer` for the unique `Cooldown Tag`, and a temporary `FGameplayTagContainer` that we will use as the return pointer of the union of our `Cooldown Tag` and the `Cooldown GE's` tags.
```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FScalableFloat CooldownDuration;

UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FGameplayTagContainer CooldownTags;

// Temp container that we will return the pointer to in GetCooldownTags().
// This will be a union of our CooldownTags and the Cooldown GE's cooldown tags.
UPROPERTY(Transient)
FGameplayTagContainer TempCooldownTags;
```

Then override `UGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags()` to return the union of our `Cooldown Tags` and any existing `Cooldown GE's` tags.
```c++
const FGameplayTagContainer * UPGGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags() const
{
	FGameplayTagContainer* MutableTags = const_cast<FGameplayTagContainer*>(&TempCooldownTags);
	MutableTags->Reset(); // MutableTags writes to the TempCooldownTags on the CDO so clear it in case the ability cooldown tags change (moved to a different slot)
	const FGameplayTagContainer* ParentTags = Super::GetCooldownTags();
	if (ParentTags)
	{
		MutableTags->AppendTags(*ParentTags);
	}
	MutableTags->AppendTags(CooldownTags);
	return MutableTags;
}
```

Finally, override `UGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown()` to inject our `Cooldown Tags` and to add the `SetByCaller` to the cooldown `GameplayEffectSpec`.
```c++
void UPGGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle Handle, const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo * ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilityActivationInfo ActivationInfo) const
{
	UGameplayEffect* CooldownGE = GetCooldownGameplayEffect();
	if (CooldownGE)
	{
		FGameplayEffectSpecHandle SpecHandle = MakeOutgoingGameplayEffectSpec(CooldownGE->GetClass(), GetAbilityLevel());
		SpecHandle.Data.Get()->DynamicGrantedTags.AppendTags(CooldownTags);
		SpecHandle.Data.Get()->SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(FName(  OurSetByCallerTag  )), CooldownDuration.GetValueAtLevel(GetAbilityLevel()));
		ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToOwner(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, SpecHandle);
	}
}
```

In this picture, the cooldown's duration `Modifier` is set to `SetByCaller` with a `Data Tag` of `Data.Cooldown`. `Data.Cooldown` would be `OurSetByCallerTag` in the code above.

![Cooldown GE with SetByCaller](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/cooldownsbc.png)

2. **Use an [`MMC`](#concepts-ge-mmc).** This has the same setup as above except for setting the `SetByCaller` as the duration on the `Cooldown GE` and in `ApplyCooldown`. Instead, set the duration to be a `Custom Calculation Class` and point to the new `MMC` that we will make.
```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FScalableFloat CooldownDuration;

UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FGameplayTagContainer CooldownTags;

// Temp container that we will return the pointer to in GetCooldownTags().
// This will be a union of our CooldownTags and the Cooldown GE's cooldown tags.
UPROPERTY(Transient)
FGameplayTagContainer TempCooldownTags;
```

Then override `UGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags()` to return the union of our `Cooldown Tags` and any existing `Cooldown GE's` tags.
```c++
const FGameplayTagContainer * UPGGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags() const
{
	FGameplayTagContainer* MutableTags = const_cast<FGameplayTagContainer*>(&TempCooldownTags);
	MutableTags->Reset(); // MutableTags writes to the TempCooldownTags on the CDO so clear it in case the ability cooldown tags change (moved to a different slot)
	const FGameplayTagContainer* ParentTags = Super::GetCooldownTags();
	if (ParentTags)
	{
		MutableTags->AppendTags(*ParentTags);
	}
	MutableTags->AppendTags(CooldownTags);
	return MutableTags;
}
```

Finally, override `UGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown()` to inject our `Cooldown Tags` into the cooldown `GameplayEffectSpec`.
```c++
void UPGGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle Handle, const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo * ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilityActivationInfo ActivationInfo) const
{
	UGameplayEffect* CooldownGE = GetCooldownGameplayEffect();
	if (CooldownGE)
	{
		FGameplayEffectSpecHandle SpecHandle = MakeOutgoingGameplayEffectSpec(CooldownGE->GetClass(), GetAbilityLevel());
		SpecHandle.Data.Get()->DynamicGrantedTags.AppendTags(CooldownTags);
		ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToOwner(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, SpecHandle);
	}
}
```

```c++
float UPGMMC_HeroAbilityCooldown::CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation(const FGameplayEffectSpec & Spec) const
{
	const UPGGameplayAbility* Ability = Cast<UPGGameplayAbility>(Spec.GetContext().GetAbilityInstance_NotReplicated());

	if (!Ability)
	{
		return 0.0f;
	}

	return Ability->CooldownDuration.GetValueAtLevel(Ability->GetAbilityLevel());
}
```

##### 4.5.15.1 Get the Cooldown Gameplay Effect's Remaining Time
```c++
bool APGPlayerState::GetCooldownRemainingForTag(FGameplayTagContainer CooldownTags, float & TimeRemaining, float & CooldownDuration)
{
	if (AbilitySystemComponent && CooldownTags.Num() > 0)
	{
		TimeRemaining = 0.f;
		CooldownDuration = 0.f;

		FGameplayEffectQuery const Query = FGameplayEffectQuery::MakeQuery_MatchAnyOwningTags(CooldownTags);
		TArray< TPair<float, float> > DurationAndTimeRemaining = AbilitySystemComponent->GetActiveEffectsTimeRemainingAndDuration(Query);
		if (DurationAndTimeRemaining.Num() > 0)
		{
			int32 BestIdx = 0;
			float LongestTime = DurationAndTimeRemaining[0].Key;
			for (int32 Idx = 1; Idx < DurationAndTimeRemaining.Num(); ++Idx)
			{
				if (DurationAndTimeRemaining[Idx].Key > LongestTime)
				{
					LongestTime = DurationAndTimeRemaining[Idx].Key;
					BestIdx = Idx;
				}
			}

			TimeRemaining = DurationAndTimeRemaining[BestIdx].Key;
			CooldownDuration = DurationAndTimeRemaining[BestIdx].Value;

			return true;
		}
	}

	return false;
}
```

**Note:** Querying the cooldown's time remaining on clients requires that they can receive replicated `GameplayEffects`. This will depend on their `ASC's` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

<a name="concepts-ge-cooldown-listen"></a>
##### 4.5.15.2 Listening for Cooldown Begin and End
To listen for when a cooldown begins, you can either respond to when the `Cooldown GE` is applied by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedDelegateToSelf` or when the `Cooldown Tag` is added by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->RegisterGameplayTagEvent(CooldownTag, EGameplayTagEventType::NewOrRemoved)`. I recommend listening for when the `Cooldown GE` is added because you also have access to the `GameplayEffectSpec` that applied it. From this you can determine if the `Cooldown GE` is the locally predicted one or the Server's correcting one.

To listen for when a cooldown ends, you can either respond to when the `Cooldown GE` is removed by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->OnAnyGameplayEffectRemovedDelegate()` or when the `Cooldown Tag` is removed by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->RegisterGameplayTagEvent(CooldownTag, EGameplayTagEventType::NewOrRemoved)`. I recommend listening for when the `Cooldown Tag` is removed because when the Server's corrected `Cooldown GE` comes in, it will remove our locally predicted one causing the `OnAnyGameplayEffectRemovedDelegate()` to fire even though we're still on cooldown. The `Cooldown Tag` will not change during the removal of the predicted `Cooldown GE` and the application of the Server's corrected `Cooldown GE`.

**Note:** Listening for a `GameplayEffect` to be added or removed on clients requires that they can receive replicated `GameplayEffects`. This will depend on their `ASC's` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

The Sample Project includes a custom Blueprint node that listens for cooldowns beginning and ending. The HUD UMG Widget uses it to update the amount of time remaining on the Meteor's cooldown. This `AsyncTask` will live forever until manually called `EndTask()`, which we do in the UMG Widget's `Destruct` event. See [`AsyncTaskCooldownChanged.h/cpp`](Source/GASDocumentation/Private/Characters/Abilities/AsyncTaskCooldownChanged.cpp).

##### 4.5.15.3 Predicting Cooldowns
Cooldowns cannot really be predicted currently. We can start UI cooldown timer's when the locally predicted `Cooldown GE` is applied but the `GameplayAbility's` actual cooldown is tied to the server's cooldown's time remaining. Depending on the player's latency, the locally predicted cooldown could expire but the `GameplayAbility` would still be on cooldown on the server and this would prevent the `GameplayAbility's` immediate re-activation until the server's cooldown expires.

The Sample Project handles this by graying out the Meteor ability's UI icon when the locally predicted cooldown begins and then starting the cooldown timer once the server's corrected `Cooldown GE` comes in.

A gameplay consequence of this is that players with high latencies have a lower rate of fire on short cooldown abilities than players with lower latencies putting them at a disadvantage. Fortnite avoids this by their weapons having custom bookkeeping that do not use cooldown `GameplayEffects`.

Allowing for true predicted cooldowns (player could activate a `GameplayAbility` when the local cooldown expires but the server is still on cooldown) is something that Epic would like to implement someday in a [future iteration of GAS](#concepts-p-future).
