#### 4.5.4 Gameplay Effect Modifiers
`Modifiers` change an `Attribute` and are the only way to [predictively](#concepts-p) change an `Attribute`. A `GameplayEffect` can have zero or many `Modifiers`. Each `Modifier` is responsible for changing only one `Attribute` via a specified operation.

| Operation  | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Add`      | Adds the result to the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute`. Use a negative value for subtraction.                    |
| `Multiply` | Multiplies the result to the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute`.                                                    |
| `Divide`   | Divides the result against the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute`.                                                  |
| `Override` | Overrides the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute` with the result.                                                   |

The `CurrentValue` of an `Attribute` is the aggregate result of all of its `Modifiers` added to its `BaseValue`. The formula for how `Modifiers` are aggregated is defined as follows in `FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase` in `GameplayEffectAggregator.cpp`:
```c++
((InlineBaseValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division
```

Any `Override` `Modifiers` will override the final value with the last applied `Modifier` taking precedence.

**Note:** For percentage based changes, make sure to use the `Multiply` operation so that it happens after addition.

**Note:** [Prediction](#concepts-p) has trouble with percentage changes.

There are four types of `Modifiers`: Scalable Float, Attribute Based, Custom Calculation Class, and Set By Caller. They all generate some float value that is then used to change the specified `Attribute` of the `Modifier` based on its operation.

| `Modifier` Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `Scalable Float`           | `FScalableFloats` are a structure that can point to a Data Table that has the variables as rows and levels as columns. The Scalable Floats will automatically read the value of the specified table row at the ability's current level (or different level if overriden on the [`GameplayEffectSpec`](#concepts-ge-spec)). This value can further be manipulated by a coefficient. If no Data Table/Row is specified, it treats the value as a 1 so the coefficient can be used to hard code in a single value at all levels. ![ScalableFloat](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/scalablefloats.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Attribute Based`          | `Attribute Based` `Modifiers` take the `CurrentValue` or `BaseValue` of a backing `Attribute` on the `Source` (who created the `GameplayEffectSpec`) or `Target` (who received the `GameplayEffectSpec`) and further modifies it with a coefficient and pre and post coefficient additions. `Snapshotting` means the backing `Attribute` is captured when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is created whereas no snapshotting means the `Attribute` is captured when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Custom Calculation Class` | `Custom Calculation Class` provides the most flexibility for complex `Modifiers`. This `Modifier` takes a [`ModifierMagnitudeCalculation`](#concepts-ge-mmc) class and can further manipulate the resulting float value with a coefficient and pre and post coefficient additions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Set By Caller`            | `SetByCaller` `Modifiers` are values that are set outside of the `GameplayEffect` at runtime by the ability or whoever made the `GameplayEffectSpec` on the `GameplayEffectSpec`. For example, you would use a `SetByCaller` if you want to set the damage to be based on how long the player held down a button to charge the ability. `SetByCallers` are essentially `TMap<FGameplayTag, float>` that live on the `GameplayEffectSpec`. The `Modifier` is just telling the `Aggregator` to look for a `SetByCaller` value associated with the supplied `GameplayTag`. The `SetByCallers` used by `Modifiers` can only use the `GameplayTag` version of the concept. The `FName` version is disabled here. If the `Modifier` is set to `SetByCaller` but a `SetByCaller` with the correct `GameplayTag` does not exist on the `GameplayEffectSpec`, the game will throw a runtime error and return a value of 0. This might cause issues in the case of a `Divide` operation. See [`SetByCallers`](#concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller) for more information on how to use `SetByCallers`. |

##### 4.5.4.1 Multiply and Divide Modifiers
By default, all `Multiply` and `Divide` `Modifiers` are added together before multiplying or dividing them into the `Attribute`'s `BaseValue`.

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase(float InlineBaseValue, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters) const
{
	...
	float Additive = SumMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Additive], GameplayEffectUtilities::GetModifierBiasByModifierOp(EGameplayModOp::Additive), Parameters);
	float Multiplicitive = SumMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Multiplicitive], GameplayEffectUtilities::GetModifierBiasByModifierOp(EGameplayModOp::Multiplicitive), Parameters);
	float Division = SumMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Division], GameplayEffectUtilities::GetModifierBiasByModifierOp(EGameplayModOp::Division), Parameters);
	...
	return ((InlineBaseValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division;
	...
}
```

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::SumMods(const TArray<FAggregatorMod>& InMods, float Bias, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters)
{
	float Sum = Bias;

	for (const FAggregatorMod& Mod : InMods)
	{
		if (Mod.Qualifies())
		{
			Sum += (Mod.EvaluatedMagnitude - Bias);
		}
	}

	return Sum;
}
```
*from `GameplayEffectAggregator.cpp`*

Both `Multiply` and `Divide` `Modifiers` have a `Bias` value of `1` in this formula (`Addition` has a `Bias` of `0`). So it would look something like:

```
1 + (Mod1.Magnitude - 1) + (Mod2.Magnitude - 1) + ...
```

This formula leads to some unexpected results. Firstly, this formula adds all the modifiers together before multiplying or dividing them into the `BaseValue`. Most people would expect it to multiply or divide them together. For example, if you have two `Multiply` modifiers of `1.5`, most people would expect the `BaseValue` to be multiplied by `1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25`. Instead, this adds the `1.5`s together to multiply the `BaseValue` by `2` (`50% increase + another 50% increase = 100% increase`). This was for the example from `GameplayPrediction.h` of a `10%` speed buff on `500` base speed would be `550`. Add another `10%` speed buff and it will be `600`.

Secondly, this formula has some undocumented rules about what values can be used as it was designed with Paragon in mind.

Rules for `Multiply` and `Divide` multiplication addition formula:
* `(No more than one value < 1) AND (Any number of values [1, 2))`
* `OR (One value >= 2)`

The `Bias` in the formula basically subtracts out the integer digit of numbers in the range `[1, 2)`. The first `Modifier`'s `Bias` subtracts out from the starting `Sum` value (set to the `Bias` before the loop) which is why any value by itself works and why one value `< 1` will work with the numbers in the range `[1, 2)`.

Some examples with `Multiply`:  
Multipliers: `0.5`  
`1 + (0.5 - 1) = 0.5`, correct

Multipliers: `0.5, 0.5`  
`1 + (0.5 - 1) + (0.5 - 1) = 0`, incorrect expected `1`? Multiple values less than `1` don't make sense for adding multipliers. Paragon was designed to only use the [greatest negative value for `Multiply` `Modifiers`](#cae-nonstackingge) so there would only ever be at most one value less than `1` multiplying into the `BaseValue`.

Multipliers: `1.1, 0.5`  
`1 + (0.5 - 1) + (1.1 - 1) = 0.6`, correct

Multipliers: `5, 5`  
`1 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 1) = 9`, incorrect expected `10`. Will always be the `sum of the Modifiers - number of Modifiers + 1`.

Many games will want their `Multiply` and `Divide` `Modifiers` to multiply and divide together before applying to the `BaseValue`. To achieve this, you will need to **change the engine code** for `FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase()`.

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase(float InlineBaseValue, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters) const
{
	...
	float Multiplicitive = MultiplyMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Multiplicitive], Parameters);
	float Division = MultiplyMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Division], Parameters);
	...

	return ((InlineBaseValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division;
}
```

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::MultiplyMods(const TArray<FAggregatorMod>& InMods, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters)
{
	float Multiplier = 1.0f;

	for (const FAggregatorMod& Mod : InMods)
	{
		if (Mod.Qualifies())
		{
			Multiplier *= Mod.EvaluatedMagnitude;
		}
	}

	return Multiplier;
}
```

##### 4.5.4.2 Gameplay Tags on Modifiers

`SourceTags` and `TargetTags` can be set for each [Modifier](#concepts-ge-mods). They work the same like the [`Application Tag requirements`](#concepts-ge-tags) of a `GameplayEffect`. So the tags are considered only when the effect is applied. I.e. when having a periodic, infinite effect, they are only taken into consideration on the first application of the effect but *not* on each periodic execution.

`Attribute Based` Modifiers can also set `SourceTagFilter` and `TargetTagFilter`. When determining the magnitude of the attribute which is the source of the `Attribute Based` Modifier, these filters are used to exclude certain Modifiers to that attribute. Modifiers which source or target didn't have all of the tags of the filter are excluded.

This means in detail: The tags of the source ASC and the target ASC are captured by `GameplayEffects`. The source ASC tags are captured, when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is created, the target ASC tags are captured on execution of the effect. When determining, if a Modifier of an infinite or duration effect "qualifies" to be applied (i.e. its Aggregator qualifies) and those filters are set, the captured tags are compared against the filters.
