#### 4.5.9 Gameplay Effect Spec
The [`GameplayEffectSpec`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/FGameplayEffectSpec/index.html) (`GESpec`) can be thought of as the instantiations of `GameplayEffects`. They hold a reference to the `GameplayEffect` class that they represent, what level it was created at, and who created it. These can be freely created and modified at runtime before application unlike `GameplayEffects` which should be created by designers prior to runtime. When applying a `GameplayEffect`, a `GameplayEffectSpec` is created from the `GameplayEffect` and that is actually what is applied to the Target.

`GameplayEffectSpecs` are created from `GameplayEffects` using `UAbilitySystemComponent::MakeOutgoingSpec()` which is `BlueprintCallable`. `GameplayEffectSpecs` do not have to be immediately applied. It is common to pass a `GameplayEffectSpec` to a projectile created from an ability that the projectile can apply to the target it hits later. When `GameplayEffectSpecs` are successfully applied, they return a new struct called `FActiveGameplayEffect`.

Notable `GameplayEffectSpec` Contents:
* The `GameplayEffect` class that this `GameplayEffect` was created from.
* The level of this `GameplayEffectSpec`. Usually the same as the level of the ability that created the `GameplayEffectSpec` but can be different.
* The duration of the `GameplayEffectSpec`. Defaults to the duration of the `GameplayEffect` but can be different.
* The period of the `GameplayEffectSpec` for periodic effects. Defaults to the period of the `GameplayEffect` but can be different.
* The current stack count of this `GameplayEffectSpec`. The stack limit is on the `GameplayEffect`.
* The [`GameplayEffectContextHandle`](#concepts-ge-context) tells us who created this `GameplayEffectSpec`.
* `Attributes` that were captured at the time of the `GameplayEffectSpec`'s creation due to snapshotting.
* `DynamicGrantedTags` that the `GameplayEffectSpec` grants to the Target in addition to the `GameplayTags` that the `GameplayEffect` grants.
* `DynamicAssetTags` that the `GameplayEffectSpec` has in addition to the `AssetTags` that the `GameplayEffect` has.
* `SetByCaller` `TMaps`.

##### 4.5.9.1 SetByCallers
`SetByCallers` allow the `GameplayEffectSpec` to carry float values associated with a `GameplayTag` or `FName` around. They are stored in their respective `TMaps`: `TMap<FGameplayTag, float>` and `TMap<FName, float>` on the `GameplayEffectSpec`. These can be used as `Modifiers` on the `GameplayEffect` or as generic means of ferrying floats around. It is common to pass numerical data generated inside of an ability to [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](#concepts-ge-ec) or [`ModifierMagnitudeCalculations`](#concepts-ge-mmc) via `SetByCallers`.

| `SetByCaller` Use | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `Modifiers`       | Must be defined ahead of time in the `GameplayEffect` class. Can only use the `GameplayTag` version. If one is defined on the `GameplayEffect` class but the `GameplayEffectSpec` does not have the corresponding tag and float value pair, the game will have a runtime error on application of the `GameplayEffectSpec` and return 0. This is a potential problem for a `Divide` operation. See [`Modifiers`](#concepts-ge-mods). |
| Elsewhere         | Does not need to be defined ahead of time anywhere. Reading a `SetByCaller` that does not exist on a `GameplayEffectSpec` can return a developer defined default value with optional warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

To assign `SetByCaller` values in Blueprint, use the Blueprint node for the version that you need (`GameplayTag` or `FName`):

![Assigning SetByCaller](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/setbycaller.png)

To read a `SetByCaller` value in Blueprint, you will need to make custom nodes in your Blueprint Library.

To assign `SetByCaller` values in C++, use the version of the function that you need (`GameplayTag` or `FName`):

```c++
void FGameplayEffectSpec::SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FName DataName, float Magnitude);
```
```c++
void FGameplayEffectSpec::SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag DataTag, float Magnitude);
```

To read a `SetByCaller` value in C++, use the version of the function that you need (`GameplayTag` or `FName`):

```c++
float GetSetByCallerMagnitude(FName DataName, bool WarnIfNotFound = true, float DefaultIfNotFound = 0.f) const;
```
```c++
float GetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag DataTag, bool WarnIfNotFound = true, float DefaultIfNotFound = 0.f) const;
```

I recommend using the `GameplayTag` version over the `FName` version. This can prevent spelling errors in Blueprint.
