#### 4.6.2 Binding Input to the ASC
The `ASC` allows you to directly bind input actions to it and assign those inputs to `GameplayAbilities` when you grant them. Input actions assigned to `GameplayAbilities` automatically activate those `GameplayAbilities` when pressed if the `GameplayTag` requirements are met. Assigned input actions are required to use the built-in `AbilityTasks` that respond to input.

In addition to input actions assigned to activate `GameplayAbilities`, the `ASC` also accepts generic `Confirm` and `Cancel` inputs. These special inputs are used by `AbilityTasks` for confirming things like [`Target Actors`](#concepts-targeting-actors) or canceling them.

To bind input to an `ASC`, you must first create an enum that translates the input action name to a byte. The enum name must match exactly to the name used for the input action in the project settings. The `DisplayName` does not matter.

From the Sample Project:
```c++
UENUM(BlueprintType)
enum class EGDAbilityInputID : uint8
{
	// 0 None
	None			UMETA(DisplayName = "None"),
	// 1 Confirm
	Confirm			UMETA(DisplayName = "Confirm"),
	// 2 Cancel
	Cancel			UMETA(DisplayName = "Cancel"),
	// 3 LMB
	Ability1		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability1"),
	// 4 RMB
	Ability2		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability2"),
	// 5 Q
	Ability3		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability3"),
	// 6 E
	Ability4		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability4"),
	// 7 R
	Ability5		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability5"),
	// 8 Sprint
	Sprint			UMETA(DisplayName = "Sprint"),
	// 9 Jump
	Jump			UMETA(DisplayName = "Jump")
};
```

If your `ASC` lives on the `Character`, then in `SetupPlayerInputComponent()` include the function for binding to the `ASC`:
```c++
// Bind to AbilitySystemComponent
FTopLevelAssetPath AbilityEnumAssetPath = FTopLevelAssetPath(FName("/Script/GASDocumentation"), FName("EGDAbilityInputID"));
AbilitySystemComponent->BindAbilityActivationToInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent, FGameplayAbilityInputBinds(FString("ConfirmTarget"),
	FString("CancelTarget"), AbilityEnumAssetPath, static_cast<int32>(EGDAbilityInputID::Confirm), static_cast<int32>(EGDAbilityInputID::Cancel)));
```

If your `ASC` lives on the `PlayerState`, there is a potential race condition inside of `SetupPlayerInputComponent()` where the `PlayerState` may not have replicated to the client yet. Therefore, I recommend attempting to bind to input in `SetupPlayerInputComponent()` and `OnRep_PlayerState()`. `OnRep_PlayerState()` is not sufficient by itself because there could be a case where the `Actor's` `InputComponent` could be null when `PlayerState` replicates before the `PlayerController` tells the client to call `ClientRestart()` which creates the `InputComponent`. The Sample Project demonstrates attempting to bind in both locations with a boolean gating the process so it only actually binds the input once.

**Note:** In the Sample Project `Confirm` and `Cancel` in the enum don't match the input action names in the project settings (`ConfirmTarget` and `CancelTarget`), but we supply the mapping between them in `BindAbilityActivationToInputComponent()`. These are special since we supply the mapping and they don't have to match, but they can match. All other inputs in the enum must match the input action names in the project settings.

For `GameplayAbilities` that will only ever be activated by one input (they will always exist in the same "slot" like a MOBA), I prefer to add a variable to my `UGameplayAbility` subclass where I can define their input. I can then read this from the `ClassDefaultObject` when granting the ability.

##### 4.6.2.1 Binding to Input without Activating Abilities
If you don't want your `GameplayAbilities` to automatically activate when an input is pressed but still bind them to input to use with `AbilityTasks`, you can add a new bool variable to your `UGameplayAbility` subclass, `bActivateOnInput`, that defaults to `true` and override `UAbilitySystemComponent::AbilityLocalInputPressed()`.

```c++
void UGSAbilitySystemComponent::AbilityLocalInputPressed(int32 InputID)
{
	// Consume the input if this InputID is overloaded with GenericConfirm/Cancel and the GenericConfim/Cancel callback is bound
	if (IsGenericConfirmInputBound(InputID))
	{
		LocalInputConfirm();
		return;
	}

	if (IsGenericCancelInputBound(InputID))
	{
		LocalInputCancel();
		return;
	}

	// ---------------------------------------------------------

	ABILITYLIST_SCOPE_LOCK();
	for (FGameplayAbilitySpec& Spec : ActivatableAbilities.Items)
	{
		if (Spec.InputID == InputID)
		{
			if (Spec.Ability)
			{
				Spec.InputPressed = true;
				if (Spec.IsActive())
				{
					if (Spec.Ability->bReplicateInputDirectly && IsOwnerActorAuthoritative() == false)
					{
						ServerSetInputPressed(Spec.Handle);
					}

					AbilitySpecInputPressed(Spec);

					// Invoke the InputPressed event. This is not replicated here. If someone is listening, they may replicate the InputPressed event to the server.
					InvokeReplicatedEvent(EAbilityGenericReplicatedEvent::InputPressed, Spec.Handle, Spec.ActivationInfo.GetActivationPredictionKey());
				}
				else
				{
					UGSGameplayAbility* GA = Cast<UGSGameplayAbility>(Spec.Ability);
					if (GA && GA->bActivateOnInput)
					{
						// Ability is not active, so try to activate it
						TryActivateAbility(Spec.Handle);
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
