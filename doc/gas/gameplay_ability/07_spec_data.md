## 개념 요약

<a name="concepts-ga-spec"></a>
#### 4.6.10 Gameplay Ability Spec
A `GameplayAbilitySpec` exists on the `ASC` after a `GameplayAbility` is granted and defines the activatable `GameplayAbility` - `GameplayAbility` class, level, input bindings, and runtime state that must be kept separate from the `GameplayAbility` class.

When a `GameplayAbility` is granted on the server, the server replicates the `GameplayAbilitySpec` to the owning client so that she may activate it.

Activating a `GameplayAbilitySpec` will create an instance (or not for `Non-Instanced` `GameplayAbilities`) of the `GameplayAbility` depending on its `Instancing Policy`.

#### 4.6.11 Passing Data to Abilities
The general paradigm for `GameplayAbilities` is `Activate->Generate Data->Apply->End`. Sometimes you need to act on existing data. GAS provides a few options for getting external data into your `GameplayAbilities`:

| Method                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Activate `GameplayAbility` by Event             | Activate a `GameplayAbility` with an event containing a payload of data. The event's payload is replicated from client to server for local predicted `GameplayAbilities`. Use the two `Optional Object` or the [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data) variables for arbitrary data that does not fit any of the existing variables. The downside to this is that it prevents you from activating the ability with an input bind. To activate a `GameplayAbility` by event, the `GameplayAbility` must have its `Triggers` set up in the `GameplayAbility`. Assign a `GameplayTag` and pick an option for `GameplayEvent`. To send the event, use the function `UAbilitySystemBlueprintLibrary::SendGameplayEventToActor(AActor* Actor, FGameplayTag EventTag, FGameplayEventData Payload)`. |
| Use `WaitGameplayEvent` `AbilityTask`           | Use the `WaitGameplayEvent` `AbilityTask` to tell the `GameplayAbility` to listen for an event with payload data after it activates. The event payload and the process to send it is the same as activating `GameplayAbilities` by event. The downside to this is that events are not replicated by the `AbilityTask` and should only be used for `Local Only` and `Server Only` `GameplayAbilities`. You potentially could write your own `AbilityTask` that will replicate the event payload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Use `TargetData`                                | A custom `TargetData` struct is a good way to pass arbitrary data between the client and server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Store Data on the `OwnerActor` or `AvatarActor` | Use replicated variables stored on the `OwnerActor`, `AvatarActor`, or any other object that you can get a reference to. This method is the most flexible and will work with `GameplayAbilities` activated by input binds. However, it does not guarantee the data will be synchronized from replication at the time of use. You must ensure that ahead of time - meaning if you set a replicated variable and then immediately activate a `GameplayAbility` there is no guarantee the order that will happen on the receiver due to potential packet loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
