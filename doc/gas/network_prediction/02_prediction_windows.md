#### 4.10.2 Creating New Prediction Windows in Abilities
To predict more actions in callbacks from `AbilityTasks`, we need to create a new Scoped Prediction Window with a new Scoped Prediction Key. This is sometimes referred to as a Synch Point between the client and server. Some `AbilityTasks` like all of the input related ones come with built-in functionality to create a new scoped prediction window, meaning atomic code in the `AbilityTasks'` callbacks have a valid scoped prediction key to use. Other tasks like the `WaitDelay` task do not have built-in code to create a new scoped prediction window for its callback. If you need to predict actions after an `AbilityTask` that does not have built-in code to create a scoped prediction window like `WaitDelay`, we must manually do that using the `WaitNetSync` `AbilityTask` with the option `OnlyServerWait`. When the client hits a `WaitNetSync` with `OnlyServerWait`, it generates a new scoped prediction key based on the `GameplayAbility's` activation prediction key, RPCs it to the server, and adds it to any new `GameplayEffects` that it applies. When the server hits a `WaitNetSync` with `OnlyServerWait`, it waits until it receives the new scoped prediction key from the client before continuing. This scoped prediction key does the same dance as activation prediction keys - applied to `GameplayEffects` and replicated back to clients to be marked stale. The scoped prediction key is valid until it falls out of scope, meaning the scoped prediction window has closed. So again, only atomic operations, nothing latent, can use the new scoped prediction key.

You can create as many scoped prediction windows as you need.

If you would like to add the synch point functionality to your own custom `AbilityTasks`, look at how the input ones essentially inject the `WaitNetSync` `AbilityTask` code into them.

**Note:** When using `WaitNetSync`, this does block the server's `GameplayAbility` from continuing execution until it hears from the client. This could potentially be abused by malicious users who hack the game and intentionally delay sending their new scoped prediction key. While Epic uses the `WaitNetSync` sparingly, it recommends potentially building a new version of the `AbilityTask` with a delay that automatically continues without the client if this is a concern for you.

The Sample Project uses `WaitNetSync` in the Sprint `GameplayAbility` to create a new scoped prediction window every time we apply the stamina cost so that we can predict it. Ideally we want a valid prediction key when applying costs and cooldowns.

If you have a predicted `GameplayEffect` that is playing twice on the owning client, your prediction key is stale and you're experiencing the "redo" problem. You can usually solve this by putting a `WaitNetSync` `AbilityTask` with `OnlyServerWait` right before you apply the `GameplayEffect` to create a new scoped prediction key.

#### 4.10.3 Predictively Spawning Actors
Spawning `Actors` predictively on clients is an advanced topic. GAS does not provide functionality to handle this out of the box (the `SpawnActor` `AbilityTask` only spawns the `Actor` on the server). The key concept is to spawn a replicated `Actor` on both the client and the server.

If the `Actor` is just cosmetic or doesn't serve any gameplay purpose, the simple solution is to override the `Actor's` `IsNetRelevantFor()` function to restrict the server from replicating to the owning client. The owning client would have his locally spawned version and the server and other clients would have the server's replicated version.
```c++
bool APAReplicatedActorExceptOwner::IsNetRelevantFor(const AActor * RealViewer, const AActor * ViewTarget, const FVector & SrcLocation) const
{
	return !IsOwnedBy(ViewTarget);
}
```

If the spawned `Actor` affects gameplay like a projectile that needs to predict damage, then you need advanced logic that is outside of the scope of this documentation. Look at how UnrealTournament predictively spawns projectiles on Epic Games' GitHub. They have a dummy projectile spawned only on the owning client that synchs up with the server's replicated projectile.
