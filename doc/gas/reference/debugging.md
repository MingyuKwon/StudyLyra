## 6. Debugging GAS
Often when debugging GAS related issues, you want to know things like:
> * "What are the values of my attributes?"
> * "What gameplay tags do I have?"
> * "What gameplay effects do I currently have?"
> * "What abilities do I have granted, which ones are running, and which ones are blocked from activating?".

GAS comes with two techniques for answering these questions at runtime - [`showdebug abilitysystem`](#debugging-sd) and hooks in the [`GameplayDebugger`](#debugging-gd).

**Tip:** Unreal Engine likes to optimize C++ code which makes it hard to debug some functions. You will encounter this rarely when tracing deep into your code. If setting your Visual Studio solution configuration to `DebugGame Editor` still prevents tracing code or inspecting variables, you can disable all optimizations by wrapping the optimized function with the `UE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION` and `UE_ENABLE_OPTIMIZATION` macros or the ship variations defined in CoreMiscDefines.h. This cannot be used on the plugin code unless you rebuild the plugin from source. This may or may not work on inline functions depending on what they do and where they are. Be sure to remove the macros when you're done debugging!

```c++
UE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION
void MyClass::MyFunction(int32 MyIntParameter)
{
	// My code
}
UE_ENABLE_OPTIMIZATION
```

### 6.1 showdebug abilitysystem
Type `showdebug abilitysystem` in the in-game console. This feature is split into three "pages". All three pages will show the `GameplayTags` that you currently have. Type `AbilitySystem.Debug.NextCategory` into the console to cycle between the pages.

The first page shows the `CurrentValue` of all of your `Attributes`:

The second page shows all of the `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` on you, their number of stacks, what `GameplayTags` they give, and what `Modifiers` they give.

The third page shows all of the `GameplayAbilities` that have been granted to you, whether they are currently running, whether they are blocked from activating, and the status of currently running `AbilityTasks`.

To cycle between targets (denoted by a green rectangular prism around the Actor), use the `PageUp` key or `NextDebugTarget` console command to go to the next target and the `PageDown` key or `PreviousDebugTarget` console command to go to the previous target.

**Note:** In order for the ability system information to update based on the currently selected debug Actor, you need to set `bUseDebugTargetFromHud=true` in the `AbilitySystemGlobals` like so in the `DefaultGame.ini`:
```
[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
bUseDebugTargetFromHud=true
```

**Note:** For `showdebug abilitysystem` to work an actual HUD class must be selected in the GameMode. Otherwise the command is not found and "Unknown Command" is returned.

### 6.2 Gameplay Debugger
GAS adds functionality to the Gameplay Debugger. Access the Gameplay Debugger with the Apostrophe (') key. Enable the Abilities category by pressing 3 on your numpad. The category may be different depending on what plugins you have. If your keyboard doesn't have a numpad like a laptop, then you can change the keybindings in the project settings.

Use the Gameplay Debugger when you want to see the `GameplayTags`, `GameplayEffects`, and `GameplayAbilities` on **other** `Characters`. Unfortunately it does not show the `CurrentValue` of the target's `Attributes`. It will target whatever `Character` is in the center of your screen. You can change targets by selecting them in the World Outliner in the Editor or by looking at a different `Character` and press Apostrophe (') again. The currently inspected `Character` has the largest red circle above it.

### 6.3 GAS Logging
The GAS source code contains a lot of logging statements produced at varying verbosity levels. You will most likely see these as `ABILITY_LOG()` statements. The default verbosity level is `Display`. Anything higher will not be displayed in the console by default.

To change the verbosity level of a log category, type into your console:

```
log [category] [verbosity]
```

For example, to turn on `ABILITY_LOG()` statements, you would type into your console:
```
log LogAbilitySystem VeryVerbose
```

To reset it back to default, type:
```
log LogAbilitySystem Display
```

To display all log categories, type:
```
log list
```

Notable GAS related logging categories:

| Logging Category          | Default Verbosity Level |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| LogAbilitySystem          | Display                 |
| LogAbilitySystemComponent | Log                     |
| LogGameplayCueDetails     | Log                     |
| LogGameplayCueTranslator  | Display                 |
| LogGameplayEffectDetails  | Log                     |
| LogGameplayEffects        | Display                 |
| LogGameplayTags           | Log                     |
| LogGameplayTasks          | Log                     |
| VLogAbilitySystem         | Display                 |
