### 4.7.4 Root Motion Source Ability Tasks
GAS comes with `AbilityTasks` for moving `Characters` over time for things like knockbacks, complex jumps, pulls, and dashes using `Root Motion Sources` hooked into the `CharacterMovementComponent`.

**Note:** Predicting `RootMotionSource` `AbilityTasks` works up to engine version 4.19 and 4.25+. Prediction is bugged for engine versions 4.20-4.24; however, the `AbilityTasks` still perform their function in multiplayer with minor net corrections and work perfectly in single player. It is possible to cherry pick the [prediction fix](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/94107438dd9f490e7b743f8e13da46927051bf33#diff-65f6196f9f28f560f95bd578e07e290c) from 4.25 into a custom 4.20-4.24 engine.
